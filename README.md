## Project Overview
This project evaluates three open-source large language models using the Ollama CLI:
- **TinyLlama (~1B parameters)**
- **Mistral-7B**
- **LLaMA2 (~7B)**

Each model was tested on:
- General Question Answering  
- Text Summarization  
- Python Code Generation  
- Creative Writing  

A focused experiment also explored how Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting affects model reasoning.

## Output Files
Raw output logs from the terminal for all four tasks and prompt tests are located in the `outputs/` folder.

## Report
The final submission report is included as `Exam_2_Report.pdf`.
